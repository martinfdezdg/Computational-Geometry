Three witches watch three shoes with Swatch watches. Which witch watches which Swatch watch? What do you think?
A- I thought a thought. But the thought I thought wasn’t the thought I thought I thought. If the thought I thought I thought had been the thought I thought, I wouldn’t have thought so much.
B- If Stugne witch chews shoes, should Stugne witch choose the shoes he chews?
C- I saw Susie witch sitting in a shoe-shine shop. Where she sits she shines, and where she shines she sits. But I leave, I have got a date at a quarter to eight; I’ll see you at the gate, so don’t be late.
